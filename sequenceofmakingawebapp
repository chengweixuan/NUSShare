1) create the html file as a Template for page, each element should have a unique id(frontend)
2) use css files(as a class or id) in html files to make it look nice
3) use a js file to incorporate functions to the elements in the html file(backend)

each html file can reference other html files to partition a page into different segments for development
js files can use the class or id of the elemnts in the html Template files to manipulate information
js files can make use of meteor libraries to do user accounts etc.
